===============

Installation
------------
1. Copy the file `plugin/toggle_mouse.vim` to your `~/.vim/plugin` directory
2. There is no step 2.


Usage
-----
Press `<F12>` to toggle mouse focus between Vim and your terminal emulator,
allowing terminal emulator mouse commands, like copy/paste.

Toggling restores the Vim 'mouse' option value to its previous value.


Customization
-------------
If you don't want to use the `<F12>` key for mouse toggling, remap it to
another key.  It autodetects whether it has been remapped and won't register
the `<F12>` key if so.

To remap the toggle to another key, add a command such as the following
example to your vim configuration file :
```
map <C-m> <Plug>ToggleMouse
```
This will map the toggle to CTRL-m.
